Orders > Orders > Add new / edit order

As a merchant, when I want to add an Order manually in my Shop.
Creating a new order is divided in 6 steps:

- Customer selection
- Customers' old orders and carts
- Order cart
- Vouchers
- Address
- Payment and status configuration

## I. Customer selection

To selected the customer, the merchant has to type any character chain that is contained in customer's first name, last name or email. 

If you don’t find a customer on the search, **a warning notification “No customers found” is displayed**.  

**Add new customer button** next to search input in case the customer does not exist in the merchant database.

The search can return multiples customer.
Each matching customer is **displayed on a card** with the customer's :

- first name,
- last name,
- ID, 
- email, 
- date of birth.

The card's footer has 2 buttons: 

- **Details button** that redirected the customer page. 
- **Choose button** that allow the merchant to proceed to the next step. The customer card is highlighted in green. 

The 50 last order and cart are displayed in tabs

nd a section appears with carts and orders, basket, vouchers and addresses.
